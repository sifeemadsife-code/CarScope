# CarScope

## Description
CarScope is a web platform that helps users explore and learn everything about cars. Through the website, users can view full specifications of any car, including performance details and estimated market prices in Egypt.  
The system also allows users to search for any car, view popular brands, and discover the best cars for each brand.

CarScope also provides detailed information about spare parts — including which parts are compatible with each car, the price of the spare part, and its function. The goal of the website is to make it easier for users to understand cars and make better decisions before buying or repairing a car.
